## Getting Started



To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and explore the different encryption techniques implemented in Python.



## Prerequisites



- Python 3.9

- Pip (Python package installer)



## Installation



1. Clone the repository:



    ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/0zymandia5/encryption_with_python.git

    cd encryption_with_python

    ```



2. Install the required packages:



    ```bash

    pip install -r requirements39.txt

    ```



## Usage



Explore the scripts in the repository to understand how each encryption technique is implemented. You can run each script individually to see the encryption and decryption processes in action.



## Encryption Techniques



### Symmetric Encryption



Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This repository includes examples of:



- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)



### Asymmetric Encryption



Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This repository includes examples of:



- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)



### Hashing



Hashing is a one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters. This repository includes examples of:



- SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)

- MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)
